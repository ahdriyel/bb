        <h1>To My Favorite Person</h1>
        
        <p>I wanted to build something just for us. A little corner of the internet that belongs to you.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for every laugh, every long talk, and for just being you. You make everything better, even the days when I'm just getting a quick trim at Bobby's and thinking about what we're doing later.</p>
        
        <p>I’m so lucky to have you in my life.</p>
